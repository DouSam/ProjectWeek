# Project Description

SlicerROS2 is an extension that enables direct communication between the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and 3D Slicer. The ROS is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. ROS2 has been developed and distrubted using an open-source model and widely used in the robotics community. The goal of SlicerROS2 is to facilitate the integration of 3D Slicer and ROS to build systems for image-guided robot-assisted intervention. 

SlicerROS2 provides UI and API to communicate with other ROS nodes through Data Distribution Service (DDS), the publish-subscribe data transport middleware used in ROS2, allowing 3D Slicer to sychnonize its scen graph (MRML) with ROS's tf. It also has an interface to load a visual model of the robot onto the Slicer scene from robot description data in the URDF format published on the ROS system.
